    A summary is a record in a reader's own words that gives the  <br>
    main points of a piece of writing such as a newspaper article, <br>
     the chapter of a book, or even a whole book. It is also possible <br>
      to summarize something that you have heard, such as a lecture, <br>
      or something that you have seen and heard, such as a movie.    <br>
