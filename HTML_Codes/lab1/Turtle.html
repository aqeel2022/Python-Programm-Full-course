<h1>The World of Turtles</h1>
<h2>A Highly Abbreviated Primer</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Turtles are diapsids of the order Testudines. The earliest known members of this group date
from the Middle Jurassic,[1] <br> making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient
group than snakes or crocodilians.</p>
<p>Turtles are ectotherms—animals commonly called cold-blooded—meaning that their internal
temperature varies <br> according to the ambient environment. However, because of their high metabolic
rate, leatherback sea turtles have a <br> body temperature that is noticeably higher than that of the
surrounding water.</p>
<h2>Anatomy</h2>
<p>The largest living chelonian is the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), which
reaches a shell length of <br> 200 cm (6.6 ft) and can reach a weight of over 900 kg (2,000 lb).</p>
<h3>Neck Retraction</h3>
<p>Turtles are divided into two groups, according to how they retract their necks into their <br>
shells (something the ancestral Proganochelys could not do).</p>
<h3>Shell</h3>
<p>The upper shell of the turtle is called the carapace. The lower shell that encases the
belly is called the plastron. <br> The carapace and plastron are joined together on the turtle's sides
by bony structures called bridges.</p>
<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>A turtle's diet varies greatly depending on the environment in which it lives. </p>
